# Harvard CS50

Here's a walkthrough my process of solving the problem set exercises that are required during the CS50 course.

## Learning programming logic!

### Understading the fundaments of programming.

Straight after the first class we were required to create a game with "Scratch" that is a programing language developed to help students.

This wasn't my first contact with programming, as I already attented to a python course a few days earlier. I do not know wheter it was related or not but for me, programing with python was a little easier, although I did the game anyway.

### Rocket Blaster

The concept on the game was, I wanted the random meteors fell on the screen and as soon as the rocket touched any of them, printed on the screen a message of game over with the points that the user made. Every meteor that fell off the screen (reaching the bottom) counted 1 point.

**This is how it came out:**
