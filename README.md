# Harvard CS50

Here's a walkthrough my process of solving the problem set exercises that are required during the CS50 course.

## Learning programming logic!

### Understading the fundaments of programming.

Straight after the first class we were required to create a game with "Scratch" that is a programing language developed to help students.

This wasn't my first contact with programming, as I already attented to a python course a few days earlier. I do not know wheter it was related or not but for me, programing with python was a little easier, although I did the game anyway.

### Rocket Blaster

I wanted the random meteors falling on the screen and as soon as the rocket touched any of them, a message would be printed on the screen saying "game over" with the points that the user made.

<br>Every meteor that fell off the screen (reaching the bottom) counted 1 point.

**This is how it came out:**

The start:

When the meteor touches the rocket:

![scratch](https://github.com/fvsteinbach/Harvard-CS50/blob/main/Scratch/rocketblaster%20game%20over.png?raw=true)

**The logic behind it:**
1. Defined how to make the rocketship moves with the arrow keys.

1. Make random meteor fall of the sky.

![meteors](https://github.com/fvsteinbach/Harvard-CS50/blob/main/Scratch/code%20that%20generates%20random%20meteors.png?raw=true)

1. Defined a condition that prints "game over" and an else to when the meteor dont touch the rocketship.
